**Brief Description**: This challenge analyzes the dataset from a recent animal study based on a sample of *249 mice* that were given various drug regimens to treat SCC (squamous cell carcinoma), a commonly occuring form of skin cancer. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development in this mice population was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, *Capomulin*, against the other treatment regimens.<br>

**Inputs**: The following two CSV files are provided as input for this challenge:
> - *Mouse_metadata.csv* - This contains important data regarding the mice treated by the different drug regimens as part of this study.
> - *Study_results.csv* - This contains the results of the animal study across the sample set of mice that will be useful for the analysis.<br>

**Outputs**: The challenge is split across the following multiple tasks each of which is organized into the corresponding Jupyter Notebook file titled *pymaceuticals_challenge*.<br>
> - Data Preparation.
> - Generating Summary Statistics.
> - Creating bar charts and pie charts for analysis.
> - Calculating quartiles based on the dataset, find outliers in the data and generating the related box plot.
> - Creating a line plot and scatter plot for analysis.
> - Calculating correlation and regression based on the data.
> - Final written analysis submitted as a writeup in the first cell of the notebook.<br>
